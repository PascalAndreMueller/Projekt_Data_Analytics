The system layout separates pressure generation from injection: a high-pressure pump supplies fuel at high pressure, and a rail on the engine serves as a high-pressure accumulator that distributes fuel to the injectors on each cylinder. Injection timing and injected quantity are calculated and controlled individually for each cylinder. Bosch states the piezo common-rail system can deliver up to ten injections per cycle. The page also mentions features such as DRS, intended to allow a smaller delay time between injections, and a new closed-loop control (NCC) that can reduce injection deviations by compensating for variables measured by sensors.
